# anki-decks
A repository to store anki decks created for my studies.

## Foreword
These decks are mainly generated using a [custom fork](https://github.com/Sawors/obsidian-auto-anki) of [obsidian-auto-anki](https://github.com/ad2969/obsidian-auto-anki)

Because these decks are **AI generated**, I cannot guarantee that their content will always be correct nor coherent. However a preliminary selection of questions and answers is done to ensure an overall good quality of information.

Despite my best efforts, some errors might find their way into the decks. **Collaboration is greatly encouraged**. If you find **any factual errors**, **typos**, or **missing context** in the cards, please do a pull request to this repository or open an issue for me to edit the card.

## Scope
The scope of this project is not to create a complete coverage of the courses, but to provide a sufficient set of information in order to consolidate some notions. Cards present in this repository ***should not be used to prepare for exams alone***. They are designed as a complementary tool, not a primary knowledge base.
